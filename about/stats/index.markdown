## Realtime Server Statistics

<img class="img_right" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/SheevaPlug_with_external_drive_enclosure.jpg/300px-SheevaPlug_with_external_drive_enclosure.jpg" />

This is a page that, in theory, should show the real-time statistics of the server for the past 24 hours.  The site is run by a [Sheevaplug] plug computer.

This server is running:

* The the-graham.com website, including:
	* This [blog].
	* A small [code repository].
* A wordpress based family oriented blog.
* A small mail server.
* File backups for my other computers.
* A few assorted other services.

Scripts to log and graph the activities are mostly unmodified versions of those written by Kenny at [computingplugs.com], a [mediawiki] setup that is itself run by a Sheevaplug.  The update scripts run every minute, and the graphs are updated every ten minutes.  They do disappear after I write a post, but they reappear in at most 10 minutes when the graphs update.
