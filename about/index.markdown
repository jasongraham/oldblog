## About Me ##

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jason_and_whittney/5089976799/" title="Getting my feet wet"><img class="img_right" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4131/5089976799_ddb0b41c2d_m_d.jpg" width="240" alt="Getting my feet wet" /></a>

My name is Jason. I'm 25 years old. I have an amazing wife, two young
daughters, and two small dogs. By day, I am an engineer at [Schweitzer
Engineering Labs][SEL].  By night, I'm an [electrical
engineering](http://www.eecs.wsu.edu/) graduate student in communication and
information theory at [Washington State University][WSU].  In the distant
future, I hope do research and possibly teach.

On the rare occasion I have free time, I enjoy playing guitar, spending time
with my family, reading sci-fi, and exploring [Linux][].

For a bit more professional or academic information on me, check out my [school
website][], though it's a bit sparse at the moment.  My wife and I also share
a [family blog][].

## About This Site ##

This is my personal blog, giving me a place to talk about my interests, blow off
steam, and have some fun. 

The color scheme for the site is based on the popular [Zenburn][] colors which
I prefer for my coding environments.  It's easy to look at for long periods of
time, and works surprisingly well for a blog.

The side is hosted on [Linode][], and using [Arch Linux][].

I compose this blog with [Vim][], manage its code with [git][], and generate the
site with [Jekyll][]. The [source code][] for the site is freely available.

The original site design was heavily inspired by similar blogs setup up by [Tate
Johnson][], [Raoul Felix][], and [Jack Moffitt][] who generously expose their
site's code to the world, to the benefit of lesser coders like me.
