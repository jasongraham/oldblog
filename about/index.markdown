## About Me

<img class="img_right" src="http://photos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc1/hs129.snc1/5528_608578287343_27200977_36481495_8296378_n.jpg" alt="" width="302" height="204" />

My name is Jason Graham. I am 23 years old. I have a lovely wife, and two small dogs. By day I am an [electrical engineering](http://www.eecs.wsu.edu/) graduate student in communication and information theory at [Washington State University](http://www.wsu.edu).  In the future, I hope do research and possibly teach.  On the rare occasion I have free time, I enjoy playing guitar, spending time with my family, reading sci-fi, and exploring Linux.  For the small snippets of spare time during the day, I tend to peruse my [blogroll].

For a bit more professional or academic information on me, check out my [school website], though it's a bit sparse at the moment.

## Contact Information

## About This Site

<img class="img_left" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/SheevaPlug_with_external_drive_enclosure.jpg/300px-SheevaPlug_with_external_drive_enclosure.jpg" />

This is my personal blog, giving me a place to talk about my interests, blow off steam, and have some fun. 

The site is powered by a [Sheevaplug] computer running [debian].  If you're curious what kind of stress you and others are putting on the tiny thing take a look at the [realtime stats].

The color scheme for the site is based on the popular [Zenburn] colors which I prefer for my coding environments.  It's easy to look at for long periods of time, and works surprising well for a the blog color scheme.

This site is composed on [vim], managed through [git], and generated by Jekyll, using the [Jekylless fork] in addition to [jekyll_ext] extension framework.  The [source code] for the site is freely available.

The site design was heavily inspired by similar blogs setup up by both [Tate Johnson], [Raoul Felix], and [Jack Moffitt] who generously expose their site's code to the world, to the benefit of lesser coders like me.
