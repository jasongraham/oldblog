Yesterday my wife and I mourned the passing of Bobby, or as he was better known to the world, [Linksys WRT54G].  He has been my faithful router and friend for nearly 5 years now, and for the entire time that I've known him, his only thoughts were to serve...packets.  Indeed, he will be missed.

On an unrelated note, I bought a new router yesterday.  Rodney (I enjoy using router names that are easy to yell at), a [Linksys WRT160n], and stepped up to take Bobby's place.  I had planned to make my next router wireless N with 1Gb wired transfer, but decided to hold off on that, seeing as routers which actually implement the [recently finalized], full [wireless N] specs aren't on the market yet, and I really have no need for 1Gb connections.  Maybe after Rodney bites the dust, or I build a media center PC I'll get one.

One important selection criteria for routers, at least for me, is the ability to flash [dd-wrt], a alternative, Linux based, open-source firmware.  It turns out that many cheap-ish routers can support many more features than the built in firmware allows, so for me, this is a cheaper way to get a [fully featured] device.  They have a nice [list of supported devices], and well written instructions on how to upgrade and configure afterwards.

I *strongly* recommend doing some searching and reading around their wiki before starting: I nearly bricked poor Rodney yesterday because I was following some generic instructions rather than the hardware specific ones.
