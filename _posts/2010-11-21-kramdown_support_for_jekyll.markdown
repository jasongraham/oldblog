**Update {{ page.updated | date:"%b %d, %Y" }}**: Added some instructions on kramdown and Jekyll, (optionally with [Coderay][]).  [Jump down][] to it.

**Update Nov. 11th 2010**: My changes have been merged into the mainline branch, which can be found on [Github][Jekyll].

The last several months I've been fiddling around with different [Markdown][] converters used with [Jekyll][Jekyll readme].  I like [Maruku's][maruku] enhanced feature set (footnotes are nice), but was dissapointed with the execution speed.  I briefly played around with [Rdiscount][], which is *much* faster, but I missed the extra features of Maruku.

I then discovered [kramdown][].  It seems like a happy middle between Maruku and Rdiscount [performance-wise][performance], while containing a feature set even larger than that of Maruku.  Unfortunately, it isn't yet supported by Jekyll, though it had been a [long requested][] feature.

I waited for a couple months, and then decided to [fork][] Jekyll and add the functionality myself.  At the time, I was unsure how to support [options][] passed to kramdown's HTML parser, so I left that part off to work on later.

[options]:http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/converter/html.html#options

Another coder apparently had the same idea as me at almost exactly the same time, and created [his own fork][] with the same functionality, but also didn't add the options passing.

With the start of Thanksgiving break, I've finally had some time to tack on the options functionality.  It goes into the [site configuration YAML file][config] just like Maruku options or Rdiscount extensions would.

Hopefully, the fork will be pulled into the main branch, though I may need to clean up the options passing portion, it admittedly feels a bit hackish.  I'm a n00b ruby coder, so my excuse is that I don't know any better.  Fixes or suggestions are welcome though.

### Using kramdown and Jekyll ###

First, be sure you are using my branch of Jekyll (or v0.8.0 or higher in the mainline).

To use kramdown with Jekyll, you will need the following in your `_config.yml` file.

{% highlight text %}
...
markdown: kramdown
...
{% endhighlight %}

See the Jekyll wiki [configuration page][config] for more of the options.

#### Adding Coderay ####

If you are wanting to additionally use Coderay for highlighting, then your `_config.yml` file must include the following.

{% highlight text %}
...
markdown: kramdown
kramdown:
  use_coderay: true
...
{% endhighlight %}

You may use a kramdown [block attribute][] within your markdown files to specify how you want Coderay to handle the highlighting for that block.

{% highlight text %}

This is a paragraph element before a highlighted block of C code.

    int main(void) {
        printf("Hello world!");
        return 0;
    }
{:lang="c"}

Another paragraph element.

{% endhighlight %}
