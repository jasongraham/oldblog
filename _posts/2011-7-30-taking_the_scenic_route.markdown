If there is one thing that I have learned in my short time on this earth, it
is that unexpected things happen.  You lay plans, only to see them torn to
sunders by [Murphy][].

As I think of all the metaphors for the unexpected happening in life the most
common I hear are "life detours", and "life throwing you a curve
ball".  Perhaps it's my aversion to road construction and baseball, but these
don't seem like positive connotations.  I can understand being upset that life
doesn't go exactly the way that you had planned it, so perhaps these are
appropriate for a great number of circumstances.  But sometimes, the
unexpected isn't so bad.

I propose a new euphemism: taking the scenic route through life:  going an
indirect route and having experiences you could otherwise have missed along the way.

With this in mind: I would like to announce that I am taking the scenic route
toward finishing my PhD.  And by this, I mean that I am blessed to experience
the opportunity of being a father.  Twice.

Near Christmas time, my wife and I are expecting twins.  And because of this,
I will be slowing down my progress toward my PhD, and taking a job at
[Schweitzer Engineering Labs][SEL].  We couldn't be happier.
