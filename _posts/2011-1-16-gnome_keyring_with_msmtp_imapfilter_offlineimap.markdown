**Update Jan 28th, 2012**: Simplified [cron](#cron) portion.  
**Update Jan 27th, 2011**: Added portion relavent to cron.  It's down at the

In my [previous post][], I walked through setting up using [mutt][], [msmtp][], [offlineimap][], [imapfilter][], and [archivemail][] to work together.  As I wrote the post, I was reminded of how bothered I felt about having passwords for my email accounts in my configuration files.  For a single user computer, this isn't a huge problem, but I would still prefer keep my passwords out of plain text.

Some searching online lead me to decide to use some pre-existing integration done using [gnome keyring][], which lets your store passwords in an encrypted form.

[gnome keyring]:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Keyring

A gnome-keyring patch for msmtp has [already been integrated][msmtp-gnome] into the `msmtp-gnome` package in the Ubuntu repositories, and a nice [script][msmtp-keyring-script] to add the appropriate data to the keyring exists.  Another great post I found explains how to [integrate offlineimap with gnome-keyring][offlineimap-gnome-keyring] with a python helper script.  It defines a couple functions that can pull the username and password directly within the configuration file.  I've updated my own configuration files and tutorial in the previous post.

I didn't find any examples of using imapfilter with gnome-keyring, but I was reminded after seeing the [example extended settings file][imapfilter-ext-config] that since the configuration files are actually Lua scripts, we can use a slightly modified version of the python helper script used with offlineimap, and then simply pipe the input into the settings file to clean up.

myuser = trim(myuser)

mypass = trim(mypass)

ACCOUNT = IMAP {
        server = 'mail.example.com',
        username = myuser,
        password = mypass,
}

{% endhighlight %}

Finally, the trick to allowing cron to access the gnome-keyring is found in
supplying it with the right environmental variable (notably,
`DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`) so that offlineimap can talk with your already
authenticated session of gnome-keyring.  My original script to do this was
really kludgey, but I found a [simpler version][] of the script from an
individual who has a very similar setup.
{: #cron}

[simpler version]:http://dev.gentoo.org/~tomka/mail.html

Take the `export_x_info.sh` script below, and make it run on startup.  Note
that is must start after DBus.

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash
# file: export_x_info.sh
# Export the dbus session address on startup so it can be used by cron
touch $HOME/.Xdbus
chmod 600 $HOME/.Xdbus
env | grep DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS > $HOME/.Xdbus
echo 'export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS' >> $HOME/.Xdbus
{% endhighlight %}

If the script is called correctly, you will see a file `~/.Xdbus` created,
that looks like the following:

{% highlight bash %}
DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:abstract=/tmp/dbus-some-long-complicated-name
export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
{% endhighlight %}

Then, you can use cron to run the following:

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash
# file: pullmail.sh
source $HOME/.Xdbus; /usr/bin/offlineimap
{% endhighlight %}

Congradulations!  You now have gnome-keyring managing your passwords for you,
and your mail is being fetched automatically.
