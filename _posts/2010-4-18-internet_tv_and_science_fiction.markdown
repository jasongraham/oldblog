Since early in our period of dating, my wife and I have been sharing our (very different) taste in TV viewing.  While I still don't especially enjoy watching [Grey's Anatomy][] with her, she has introduced me to sit-coms such as [Friends][] which my family and social circle really hadn't been interested in.

For my part, I'm especially happy that I've been able to convert my wife into a new science-fiction junky.  I've been quite happily revisiting some of my favorites with her, and exploring new ones together as well.  [Netflix][] and [hulu][] have been great resources for us in doing this.  We've actually gotten rid of our cable TV subscription, since the majority of what we want to see can be found for free (and legally) online.

### Things We've Seen ###

+ __[Firefly][] and [Serenity][]__

	We started these as we were dating.  They combine the genres of science-fiction and western, in a way that mixes humor with a dusting of some darker themes, which I thought made it perfect for those sort of new to science fiction.  Firefly was a very enjoyable series, and I was sad to see it die such an early death.  I thought it had a lot of potential.

+ __[Stargate SG-1][]__

	Stargate continues on the lighter, more humorous side of sci-fi.  I think this is what sold my wife on the genre as a whole.  If you haven't tried this series, I suggest giving it a shot.

### Flops ###

+ __[Farscape][]__

	I thought this might be interesting, considering it had two of the actors (Ben Browder and Claudia Black) that appeared in the much enjoyed earlier in SG-1.  I liked that they made the universe truly alien, at least in appearance.  Ironically, Whittney did not like this aspect.  I eventually was turned off by what I feel was a weak story, but to be fair, I should probably try a couple more episodes to be sure.

### What We're Watching Now ###

+ __[Battlestar Galactica][]__

	Whittney and I just started this one.  I was worried initially that Whittney wouldn't like it, because the themes are much darker than the earlier series, but she is loving it.  I've seen up through the start of season 3, but I haven't seen the rest, so eventually it will be new for both of us.  I need to borrow a couple more seasons from my parents next we see them.

+ __[Stargate Universe][]__

	Available on [hulu][].  This has a different, slightly darker take on the stargate story.  I think they're trying to emulate the feel of Battlestar Galactica, but they aren't succeeding.  The story is ok, but it feels out of place after the earlier SG-1 and Atlantis series.

### Future Ideas ###

+ __[Babylon 5][]__

	I've heard good things about this series in the past.  I don't know much about it, but it sounds intriguing, especially considering I come from more of a Star Trek background.

+ __Star Trek__

	I would be interested in revisiting some of [TNG][], [DS9][], and [Voyager][] episodes that I remember from high school and earlier.  The future they present is much more sanitized in its themes than more recent sci-fi, but they were still enjoyable, and the story was quite good.  I think Whittney may like them.

Does anyone have any further ideas on good television science fiction that my wife might like?
