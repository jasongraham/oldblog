When my wife and I were on our [anniversary vacation on Whidbey], I was sad that the wireless internet access provided to us was unencrypted.  I suppose that I should be glad that any existed at all, since Whittney and I were able to use Netflix as we were there.

I wanted at the time to be able to set up a [ssh tunnel] to my home server, running the website that you're reading.  The tunnel itself is encrypted, so it would be equivalent security-wise to any browsing that I would do from home.  Something like this would be greatly helpful for using the web at the airport or your local coffee shop.

<!-- EXTENDED -->

Anyway, I had a chance to finally set up a script to allow me to easily open and close a tunnel.  Strictly speaking, this is as easy as using the `ssh -D user@server` command, but I wanted to script it somehow.

### The Script ###

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash
#
# A simple script to set up or stop a SSH tunnel
# to my home server.
#
# Usage: 
#
#	proxy start
#		Sets up the tunnel and saves the PID in /tmp/ssh_tunnel_id.txt
#
#	proxy stop
#		Reads the process id from /tmp/ssh_tunnel_id.txt and kills that process.

PORT=8080 # The local port to be used for forwarding.  Change if desired.

REMOTE=homeserver # Your server. Mine is aliased in ~/.ssh/config as homeserver, but
		  # this would typically be something like user@server or similar.

PIDFILE=/tmp/ssh_tunnel_pid.txt # will just hold the numeric process id of the tunnel


if [ $# -gt 0 ] ; then # if we pass an arguement (ie, start or stop)

  if [ $1 = start ] ; then
    # make sure there is not an open tunnel already
    if [ -f $PIDFILE ] ; then
      echo "A tunnel is already opened.  No action has been taken."
    else
      # Open the tunnel. We background this ourselves because
      # I don't need a password since I am using passkey pairs, and
      # I can then get at the PID using the '$!' in bash, which doesn't
      # work when passing ssh the -f to background itself.
      ssh -ND localhost:$PORT $REMOTE &

      # save the PID of the tunnel to the PID file
      echo $! > $PIDFILE

      echo "Tunnel has been opened on localhost:$PORT"
    fi
  elif [ $1 = stop ] ; then
    if [ -f $PIDFILE ] ; then # a tunnel is opened, so shut it
      kill `cat $PIDFILE`
      rm $PIDFILE
      echo "Tunnel has been closed."
    else # no PID file exists, must not have a tunnel opened.
      echo "Cannot find a PID file $PIDFILE.  Are you sure a tunnel is open?"
    fi

  else # neither start nor stop is passed
    echo "Use \"$0 start\" to start a proxy, or \"$0 stop\" to stop the proxy."
  fi

else # no arguements were passed
  echo "Use \"$0 start\" to start a proxy, or \"$0 stop\" to stop the proxy."
fi
{% endhighlight %}

### Firefox Configuration ###

I used the [FoxyProxy Basic] addon for Firefox to easily switch between proxied or no-proxy modes.  Use a socks version 5 connection type when setting up the proxy, to localhost and port 8080 (or whatever you want, just change the script).

If you don't want to use an addon, you can also enable the proxy manually through the `about:config` screen by following [this helpful tutorial].

### Chromium Configuration ###

Here, as with Firefox, you can enable the proxy manually or with addons to help manage the proxy switching for you.  The manual configuration is under `Wrench Button` &rarr; `Options` &rarr; `Under the Hood` &rarr; `Change Proxy Settings`.  Set up localhost and port 8080 (or change the port to whatever you want, changing the script as well) using a Socks version 5 connection (leave the others blank) and you're golden.

Many extensions exist to help manage proxy settings in the extensions library.  As a side note which I find unsurprising, many are maintained by authors with Chinese looking names.
