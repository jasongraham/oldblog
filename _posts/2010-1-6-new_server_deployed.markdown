I've spent some spare time over the past couple days setting up my new toy: known as a [SheevaPlug].  This website is now running off of it.  I've enjoyed tinkering with the thing putting it together, and Whittney would no doubt tell you that I've quite pleased with myself (and I am).  The process is documented in [a new howto] I put together, if anyone is interested in seeing it.
