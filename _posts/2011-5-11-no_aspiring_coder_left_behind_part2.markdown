Having finished another semester with introductory computer science
classes, I wanted to compare with my first semester of help teach
a similar course.  This most recent semester's course can be thought
of as an (optional) introductory class to the one I taught the
previous semester, and is most definitely student's first look at
coding.

I [concluded previously][] that I wanted to do less tutorial style
programming.  Excessive hand-holding I felt hurt the students later in
the semester, especially during exams.
So with this most recent class, both the instructor and I tried to let
the students be more independent during the lab sections.

Through this, I've decided that it takes a very specific kind of
student to thrive in this environment: self-directed, willing to
experiment, and slow to frustrate.
With only one of me and roughly 20 students in a lab sections, it
takes me a while to help each student individually.  Those which did
best seemed to be those who could apply what they knew already to
guess how to convert their thoughts into Python, or more importantly,
to learn how to think in such a structured way.

For the rest, however, there didn't seem to be much of a difference.
The programming portions of the midterm and final were sadly evenly
split between sink and swim.  If anything, the early lack of tutorials
seemed to hurt the majority of students.  We did for the last third of
the class start doing this, however, and the quality of the homework
submissions improved greatly.

In these introductory classes, when retention is a goal, the guided
programming model seems to work very well.  I'd be curious to try
starting the semester with more tutorials and gradually removing them
next time.
