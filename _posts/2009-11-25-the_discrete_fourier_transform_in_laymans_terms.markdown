title: The Discrete Fourier Transform in Layman's Terms
tags: [school, DSP]

There's a nice explaination of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) in an decently [easy to understand for the uninitiated](http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2009/explained-fourier.html) published by the MIT News Office. It may not be paticularly exciting, but if anyone wants a conceptual understanding of some of the mathematic plumbing behind signal processing (a big part of what I'm studying), its a decent read.

Also a [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform) on the subject, with some equations for those desiring a headache.
