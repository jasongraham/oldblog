After using [Gmail][] for many years, about a year ago my academic advisor
introduced me to [mutt][].  I've been using it as my mail reader ever since,
in combination with [offlineimap][], [imapfilter][], [msmtp][], and most
recently [archivemail][].  The setup is highly customizable, incredibly fast,
and since the configuration is completely in text files, I can quickly make
and keep track of changes across my multiple computers with [git][].

[gmail]:http://gmail.com/
[mutt]:http://www.mutt.org/
[offlineimap]:https://github.com/jgoerzen/offlineimap/wiki
[imapfilter]:http://imapfilter.hellug.gr/
[msmtp]:http://msmtp.sourceforge.net/
[archivemail]:http://archivemail.sourceforge.net/
[git]:http://git-scm.com/

The downside of this approach is it requires a bit of time and possibly
troubleshooting up-front to configure.  But as always, Google is your friend.
Several other good tutorials exist explaining how to use and configure these
tools in various combinations, and I wanted to add examples from my own
configuration to the mix in the hope that others find them useful.

Some would also point out that mutt really could technically do most of this
by itself.  This absolutely works, but I like to have a division of labor of
sorts, splitting up the fetching, sorting, sending, and reading between
different programs.  After all, it is the [Unix Philosophy][].

My example setup will include two inboxes: one for school, and one for Gmail.
I have a few more mailboxes than this setup, but it's easy to extend from this
as per your own needs.

### Preparation ###

It's easiest to keep everything together under one directory for git to keep
track of.  From there, we can use symlinks or specify directly within the
various commands about where the configuration files are.

I've created an [example repository on Github][] for those that want to follow
along with a similar file structure.  Note that to go from example to working
copy will require a bit of editing.

### Syncing mail with Offlineimap ###

[Offlineimap][] uses the [IMAP][] protocol to synchronize a local copy of all
your email messages for multiple accounts in a [maildir][] format.  Having
your email be local means that reading is fast, since the email has already
been downloaded to your machine.  Any changes you make such as deleting,
changing flags (important, read, unread,...), or moving the email to
a different folder are performed on the local copy, which is periodically
synchronized with the remote copy.

[imap]:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol
[maildir]:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir

A [fully annotated configuration file][offlineimap_full_example_config] is
available if you want to see all the bells and whistles available.
Alternately, check out the [minimal configuration][offlineimap_minimal_config]
needed to get working.  My example configuration is
[here][my_offlineimap_config].

[offlineimap_full_example_config]:https://github.com/jgoerzen/offlineimap/blob/master/offlineimap.conf
[offlineimap_minimal_config]:https://github.com/jgoerzen/offlineimap/blob/master/offlineimap.conf.minimal
[my_offlineimap_config]:https://github.com/jasongraham/mail_conf_example/blob/master/offlineimaprc

[suggested setup]:#preparation

I suggest that you test it from the terminal to make sure that it's working at
this point.  You will need to disable the hook to imapfilter if you haven't
configured it yet.  Other sources of errors may be the port number, or if
you're trying to connect to Gmail, be sure you have [enabled IMAP][] in the
Gmail interface.

[enabled IMAP]:https://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=77695

{% highlight bash %}
offlineimap -c ~/.mail_configs/offlineimaprc
{% endhighlight %}

### Sorting mail with Imapfilter ###

[Imapfilter][] is another program which is able to sort and move messages
around on the IMAP server.  I use it before calling offlineimap to sort my
mail into the correct folder (ie, messages for a certain class into a given
folder).  The configuration file can use [regular expressions][] to do the
sorting, and is extendable using [Lua][], if you want to do so.

[regular expressions]:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression_examples
[Lua]:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)

Sorting can take place based on who an email is sent from, sent to, title
contents, body contents, other header information, email size, age of the
email, email status (recent, unread,...) and many other possibilities in
combination.

[My example configuration][my_imapfilter_config] is actually quite simple.
You should really look at the [configuration manual][imapfilter_config_manual]
and especially another [example][imapfilter_config_example] to see other
things you can do with it.

[my_imapfilter_config]:https://github.com/jasongraham/mail_conf_example/blob/master/imapfilter/school.lua
[imapfilter_config_manual]:http://imapfilter.hellug.gr/imapfilter_config.5.txt
[imapfilter_config_example]:http://imapfilter.hellug.gr/sample.config.lua.txt

You can test your configuration using the following command.

{% highlight bash %}
imapfilter -vc ~/.mail_configs/imapfilter/file_name.lua
{% endhighlight %}

### Reading mail with Mutt ###

Now that you hopefully have your email synchronized to your machine, it's time
to set up [mutt][] to read it.  This is the most configuration intensive
portion of this how-to, but fortunately we can split up mutt's configuration
file in a sensible and modular way for simplicity.

Before I throw down my own configuration files, I will point you to a page
with a list of several different [mutt configuration examples][].  They have
varying levels of documentation in them, and try to do different things.  This
is, again, because mutt is _so darn configurable_ that it really can do just
about anything you want to do.  As I mentioned previously, most of these
setups let mutt handle everything regarding connecting to IMAP servers,
sorting, connecting to SMTP servers to send and some other things.  It's
a good place to look for ideas.

[mutt configuration examples]:http://wiki.mutt.org/?ConfigList

Moving on to my own configuration: the configuration files are split up as
follows:

+ [muttrc][]: This is the main configuration file.  All the other
  configuration files are included from this file.
+ [common][]: Some global settings that I want to apply to every email account
  I read.
+ [colors][]: What the colors you want to be used in the display are.  It uses
  the same Zenburn color scheme as this blog appears in.
+ [macros][]: A set of a few keybindings that I find useful.
+ [mailcap][]: This file tells mutt how to open attachments automatically.
  Your distribution may come with it's own mailcap file.  If so, I recommend
  that you remove the `set mailcap_path` statement in the `common` file and
  use it (unless you want to override it as I have).
+ [pgp][]: If you do use use [pgp][pgp_encryption] or [gpg][] encryption or
  signing email (or want to do so, all the cool kids are doing it :P), then
  this is the configuration file for doing that.  If you have no idea or
  interest in this, then ignore this file and remove the corresponding source
  statement from the muttrc file.
+ [school][school_mutt_conf] and [gmail][gmail_mutt_conf]: These are
  configuration files that are specific to the these specific email accounts,
  such as account specific signatures and such.  See the folder hooks in
  [muttrc][] used to load these based on what folder mutt is looking at.
  Also, notice that these are very simple configuration files.  It is trivial
  to add more if you have more email accounts.

[muttrc]:https://github.com/jasongraham/mail_conf_example/blob/master/mutt/muttrc
[common]:https://github.com/jasongraham/mail_conf_example/blob/master/mutt/common

### Sending mail with Msmtp ###

[Msmtp][] is a very simple [SMTP][] client.  It contacts the SMTP server with
your account credentials when you send mail, and then passes the sent email to
the server.

[smtp]:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol

To use it, first set up your configuration file.  My example configuration
file is [here][my_msmtp_configuration], but you can also look at [another
simple example][msmtp_simple_example].

[my_msmtp_configuration]:https://github.com/jasongraham/mail_conf_example/blob/master/msmtprc
[msmtp_simple_example]:http://msmtp.sourceforge.net/doc/msmtprc.txt

Once you have your file set up, you can test it from the terminal to make sure
it's working.  Assuming that it is working, you should see information about
the SMTP server and the encryption certificate flash by, otherwise, there is
an error.  In particular, if a self-signed certificate is being used, or
a certificate from an uncommon signing authority, you may need to ignore the
certificate check as shown in my configuration file.  Also, check to see what
ports are being used by the server in question.

{% highlight bash %}
# Replace ACCOUNT_NAME with your account.
# In my example, this would be either 'school' or 'gmail'.
msmtp -C ~/.mail_configs/msmtp -Sa ACCOUNT_NAME
{% endhighlight %}

### Saving old emails with Archivemail ###

Here is an example that will take all mail from before January 1st, 2011
within the directory or file `cpts111`, and put it into a [gzipped][gzip]
[mbox][] file `cpts111_records_fall_2010.gz`.

[gzip]:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip
[mbox]:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox

{% highlight bash %}
archivemail -D 2011-1-1 -uv --archive-name cpts111_records_fall_2010 cpts111
{% endhighlight %}

I can also iterate over all the directories correspoding to each class that
I have set up.  A separate archive for each directory will be created.  My
inboxes relating to classes are labeled starting with their with either 'ee'
or 'cpts'.

{% highlight bash %}
ls | egrep "^(cpts|ee)" | xargs archivemail -D 2011-1-1 -uvs _records_fall2010
{% endhighlight %}

{% comment %}
silly markdown highlight fix_
{% endcomment %}

It is also possible to set up archivemail to run from a cron job and keep
a running archive, keeping your inbox clean of files older than a certain
number of days, but as I don't use this personally, I leave the explanation to
others.  Check out the man page for archive mail or Google to read many good
examples online.

### Encrypting your Passwords with Gnome-Keyring ###

I've written [another post][] with links pointing to keeping your passwords
encrypted with Gnome-Keyring rather than having them be in plain text in your
configuration files.  For a single person computer, the above portion works
just fine, but encryption never hurts.

To summarize, here are the links from the other post to integrate [msmtp with
gnome-keyring] and [offlineimap with gnome-keyring].  Imapfilter integration
is explained in [my own post][another post].

Take a look at the files in the [lib directory][] of my example configuration
for the helper files, and how they are used in each of the configuration
files.
