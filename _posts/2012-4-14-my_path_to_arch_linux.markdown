title: My path to Arch Linux
tags: [Arch, Ubuntu, Linux]

When I started using Linux 5 years ago, [Ubuntu][] was a wonderful
distribution for me.  It was easy to set up, made access to drivers easy, and
had a giant repository of software.  Between [Octave][] and the myriad of
programming tools available, I was set for my engineering coarsework[^1].
And for downtime, [Wine][] let me satisfy my [World of Warcraft][] addiction.

[Octave]:https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/
[Wine]:http://www.winehq.org/

[^1]: Indeed, looking for an alternative to buying or pirating [Matlab][] was
      what lead me to try Linux in the first place.  All I needed to know was that
      I could use Open Office to write documents and still find a way to play games.

Over time, my computing aesthetic taste gradually trended minimalist.
I realized while Ubuntu comes by default with a wealth of useful applications
installed by default, I never used them.  They cluttered my menus and disk
drive.  My next several Ubuntu installs used the text based [alternate
installer][] to build up only what I needed from a clean slate.

Simultaneously, I explored shell scripting, using [conky][] to keep track of
my system status, [mutt][] to view my email in the terminal, and [vim][] to
edit my files.  I realized that I felt more in control of my computing
experience this way.  I was hooked.

All this time I was using Gnome 2 as my desktop environment, but was
intersting in trying alternatives.  The Gnome Project's introduction of
version 3 of their [desktop environment][Gnome3], and Ubuntu's switch to
[Unity][] gave me the excuse I needed to do so, since I would be switching
anyway.

[Unity]:http://unity.ubuntu.com/

And since I was looking for alternatives, why not try a different distribution
too?  [Arch Linux][] seemed like a great alternative to someone with my
tastes.  The [project aims][Arch Way] to be simple, elegant, user-centric, open, and
free (as in freedom).  From the previous link, on simplicity:

> Arch Linux defines simplicity as without unnecessary additions,
> modifications, or complications, and provides a lightweight UNIX-like base
> structure that allows an individual user to shape the system according to
> their own needs. In short: an elegant, minimalist approach.

Just what I was looking for!  Moreover, they have excellent documentation
through their [wiki][Arch Wiki].  I had never found a comparable source of
knowledge for Ubuntu.  I highly recommend looking through it and using it as
a resource even if you don't use Arch.

I've been using Arch for almost a year now.  I have 3 machines running it:

+ My desktop, using [xmonad][] as a window manager.
+ A Thinkpad laptop, using Gnome 3 so that my wife is able to find her way
  around as well.  She doesn't share my minimalist aesthetic.
+ I ended up renting a server on [Linode][] that is using Arch.  My home
  server is having some trouble, and I haven't had the time to mess with it at
  a hardware level yet.  I've been quite happy with them so far.

If you are like me, and enjoy both minimal aesthetic and the feeling of
complete control over your machine, consider using [Arch Linux][].

Feel free to share your experiences in the comments.
