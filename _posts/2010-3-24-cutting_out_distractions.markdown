This week I've spent something on the order of four hours in [Les Schwab] getting our two cars' studded winter tires changed out.  The [deadline] for removing them before the police can start fining you is at the end of the month, thus explaining the wait.

To pass the time, I was a good student and worked on some homework that I didn't need my computer for.  From this I discovered, to my dismay, that I am _much_ more productive when not seated in from of a computer screen.  The internet can be very distracting, with [Google Reader], [twitter] and email constantly updating.

There was a time, in high school and the through the end of undergrad, when I was very driven and focused; I was able to sit for hours pushing through homework.  Now it seems that I take breaks at perhaps half hour intervals, which last probably longer than they should.

I need to find myself a method of cutting out some of the distractions that I face.  I have the following ideas:

1. Turn off the computer.
	+ **Pros**: Eliminates distractions.
	+ **Cons**: Sometimes I need to look up math references online, and I like to listen to music/news online.

2. Just turn off the monitor.
	+ **Pros**: Harder for distractions to capture my attention.  Able to quickly look of references.  Able to listen to music/news.
	+ **Cons**: Distractions are still present, though less apparent.

3. Work more at school, less at home.
	+ **Pros**: It _can_ be an environment more conducive to working...
	+ **Cons**: ...but frequently isn't.  So overall, not much different.  Also, the dogs would be kenneled for longer periods.

I'm leaning toward shutting off the monitor and seeing how that works.  Perhaps I can regain some of my productivity.

With all the distraction the computer brings, I'm curious how people that code for a living keep their focus.  I hear that often, one has an IDE open, perhaps a web browser for documentation, and assorted shells, file manager windows, etc.  I'm sure it becomes an issue there as well.
