While trolling the [Jekyll wiki] to see what [sites people have designed] using Jekyll, I came across one blog of a coder who has recently [stumbled into Vim].  Aside from using the very useful `vimtutor` command, from which I learned Vim basics, he links to an [entertaining video] showing many of the features that make Vim freaking awesome as an editor.

It's a touch long, but amusing if you have the time for it.  Some of the plugins shown in the video look useful, and are one's I haven't seen before.

The video author also has many more [tutorial videos] about Vim, as well as resources on his [web site].
