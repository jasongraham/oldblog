My wife and I have just gotten back from a vacation in Whidbey, and we're wanting to post photos.  We're both wanting to start weaning ourselves off of [facebook][], so I've been looking at alternatives for photo sharing.

[facebook]:http://www.facebook.com

The qualities that I've been looking for are:

0. I don't want to host the photos myself on this server.  My upstream bandwidth sucks.
1. I want to _own_ the copyright to the photos, not give rights to the service.
2. I would like to not have an limit on storage or upload bandwidth.
3. I would like the service to be free (or at least, not too expensive).

So far, I haven't been able to find anything that satisfies my requirements. Popular free versions of services often have bandwidth or storage limitations, such as [Flickr][], [Picasa][], and just about everything else I've looked for.

[Flickr]:http://www.flickr.com
[Picasa]:http://picasaweb.google.com/

[Zoomr][] is free and unlimited (though their signups appear to be closed at the time of posting), but in it's [TOS][] they state (emphasis mine)

[Zoomr]:http://www.zooomr.com/
[TOS]:http://www.zooomr.com/about/tos/

> By posting User Content to any part of the Site, you automatically grant, and you represent and warrant that you have the right to grant, to the Company an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid, worldwide license __(with the right to sublicense)__ to use, copy, publicly perform, publicly display, reformat, translate, excerpt (in whole or in part) and distribute such User Content for __any purpose__, commercial, advertising, or otherwise, on or in connection with the Site or the promotion thereof, to prepare derivative works of, or incorporate into other works, such User Content, and to grant and authorize sublicenses of the foregoing.

These licence terms are basically equivalent to what [facebook][] does.  I won't begrudge either company the right to make money, but I'd rather not give anyone a licence to do whatever they want with my family pictures.

It looks like if I don't want to give the service that I'm using rights to the photos, I am going to need to fork over some cash instead.  I'm thinking that paying for [Flickr][] would be the best bet, unless someone else offers a better option.
