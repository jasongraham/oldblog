Whittney and I are back in Pullman after the holidays.  I have another week until school starts, so I expect to have some time to get some work done, and maybe play a bit of [Guild Wars] as well.

A few days ago, I threw my [school website] together quickly using the [code for this blog]. I'll probably change both sites layout a bit.  My thoughts are the WSU colors work better for the school site, so I'll definitely change the coloring here, but other than that, I'm not sure what to do yet.

Over the break, my battery backup power supply running to the server and network equipment had some hiccup.  This has happened a few times for me, and its exceedingly annoying.  I'll have to look into getting a new one.

I hope everyone had a wonderful holiday season.
