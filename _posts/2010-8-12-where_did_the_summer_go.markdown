It's amazing to me how quickly the summer went.  In less than two weeks, classes start up again.  This semester, I'll be a TA for some as of yet unknown class.  My advisor is hoping I get assigned to [his RF class][] which includes a lab section, which is probably a strong sign that I actually will.  If that's true I'll be busy grading many assignments and labs.

In the spring, shortly after the school year ended, I wrote a post about my [summer goals][].  Let's see how I did.

Truly, I'm not sure what happened to all my time.  I don't think there's anything wrong with setting too many or high goals for oneself, but perhaps I overdid it.  Next year I think I'll have to try a bit harder.  Hopefully I'll be able to make more progress with research so I can accomplish more.

As far as what classes I'll be taking fall semester, I'm taking classes titled _"Estimation Theory for Signal Processing, Communications and Control"_, and _"Computer Communication Networks"_, which is a popular class for both the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science grads.

Here's to a new (exciting?) semester.
