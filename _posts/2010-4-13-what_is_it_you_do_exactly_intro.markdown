One late night conversation with my wife lead me to realize that defining my focus of study, let alone describing the general field that I'm studying, is a very difficult thing.  Its one thing to tell people that I study 'communication and information theory', but its another thing to give another quick, one sentence clarifier as to what exactly that means.

So I'd like to do a series of posts that attempts to explain, through means accessible to someone who isn't necessarily an engineer or scientist, what exactly I do.  I expect to do this series over the next several months, probably ending at some point toward the start of fall semester in August or so, and will be of course be interrupted by posts about other things.

My hope is that others will enjoy reading these as I explore my field a bit.
