Yesterday, my wife made my day.

She is considering a slight career change, and getting additional training online to become a [sonographer].  Since the training is online, apparently it requires you to have some specific software on your computer, which of course is designed for Windows (which is fine, I'm not knocking on that, though it would be nicer if it was purely run through the browser).

Anyway, as she's telling me that the software only runs on Windows, she comments:

> It's too bad it doesn't run on Linux, it's so much faster than Windows.

I have officially converted my wife.  Now, maybe I can get to the rest of my family.
