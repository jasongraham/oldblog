Its been a while since I've made a post.  I've had quite a bit on my plate.

My wife will soon be giving birth to twin girls.  We're excited, anxious, and
I think ready for the suspense to end so we can finally meet them.  I soon
will have the joy and challenge of identifying with young girls (I have no
sisters), and having tea parties, playing dress up, and enjoying a more pink
and pastel color palate.

I've been working at [Schweitzer Engineering Labs][SEL] for the past several
months, mostly doing firmware and [RTL][] work on communications systems.
It's great to be finally applying the years of schooling that I've had to the
real world, especially in an industry that is actually making the world
a better place, rather than building the latest [disposable income
waster][ipad].

Progress on research and school continues, though very slowly.  The masters
student working with us previously has done an admirable job stepping in and
taking over the lead role in developing the signal processing.  And he'll have
much more to talk about for his thesis now too.  As for classes, I took
a single graduate math class this semester.  I am happy to say that I am now
capable of (correctly) proving various mathematical trivia.  No, I'm not
bitter about having to take this class. 

My one regret with my new routine is that I have even less time to spend with
family than I did before.  Taking even one class requires me to spend another
3 or 4 hours a week in lecture, and spend another 3 or 4 hours doing homework
or studying.  Ideally, I have a few hours to continue working on research, say
6 on a week.  Between just these, it's like working full time 7 days a week.
I haven't been able to put in that amount of time (and fortunately, the math
class didn't have homework), but I'm worried about any more classes that I'll
need to take.

There are three classic options available for one's time in school: studying,
socializing, and sleeping.  The presenter's thesis was that you can only
succeed in two of these three activities.  I feel like I have a fourth area of
work now on top of all that.

So I submit this plea that I retain the ability to work toward my life and
career goals, while having time to enjoy the journey as well.
