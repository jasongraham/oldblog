My wife and I enjoyed our first wedding anniversary on [Whidbey Island] this last week.  We stayed at a [cute house with a view], and enjoyed going hiking at Forts [Casey] and [Ebey], seeing the animals at the [Woodland Park Zoo], and nerding out at the [Pacific Science Center], among other activities.
